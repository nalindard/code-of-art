# Code of Art - ASCII Wallpaper Generator

A fun project that transforms beautiful Bing wallpapers into stunning ASCII art! This automated system fetches daily wallpapers from Bing (via Japan region) and converts them into colorful ASCII representations in multiple formats.

## What it does

- Fetches the latest Bing wallpaper daily
- Converts images to ASCII art with color preservation
- Organizes output by date in `data/YYYY/MM/` structure
- Generates multiple formats: HTML, plain text, and ANSI terminal
- Runs automatically via GitHub Actions every day at midnight UTC

## Output Formats

Each wallpaper generates three files:

- **`.html`** - Colorful ASCII art viewable in web browsers
- **`.txt`**  - Plain text ASCII art without colors
- **`.ansi`** - Terminal-friendly ASCII with ANSI color codes

## How to View the Art

### Web Browser (HTML)
```bash
# Serve the HTML file locally
bunx serve data/2025/09/
# Then open: http://localhost:3000/filename.html

# Or directly download open the HTML file
```

### Terminal (ANSI colors)
```bash
# View colorful ASCII in terminal
cat data/2025/09/filename.ansi
```

### Plain Text
```bash
# View plain ASCII art
cat data/2025/09/filename.txt
```

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nalindard/code-of-art.git

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run manually
bun start
```
